# Contributing

Thanks for considering a contribution to **My Computer for Nautilus**.

## Design philosophy

We follow the [GNOME Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.gnome.org/hig/) and
Adwaita design and interaction patterns as closely as possible, the goal is for **My
Computer** to feel like a native part of Nautilus, not a bolted-on plugin. Prefer existing
libadwaita/GTK widgets and style classes over custom CSS or bespoke widgets, and check
that any new interaction matches how Nautilus itself already behaves.

## Before you open a pull request

**Base your pull request on the `dev` branch, not `main`.** `main` only receives tested,
released changes; `dev` is where ongoing work and contributions land before a release.
If your PR is opened against `main` by mistake, you can retarget it to `dev` from the
pull request's "Edit" button on GitHub.

## Translations

Adding or improving a translation is the easiest way to contribute.

1. Find your language's `.po` file under `po/`. If it doesn't exist yet, copy `po/fr.po`
   (our reference, kept fully up to date) as a starting point, rename it to your language
   code (e.g. `po/hu.po` for Hungarian), and update the header fields (`Language`,
   `Language-Team`, `Last-Translator`, `PO-Revision-Date`).
2. Translate each `msgstr` below its matching `msgid`. Leave `msgid` lines untouched.
3. Open a pull request with just the `.po` file change.

You don't need to compile `.mo` files or update the version, that's handled at release time.

## Code contributions

1. Open an issue first for anything beyond a small fix, so we can agree on the approach.
2. Keep the single-file structure (`nautilus-my-computer.py`), don't split it into modules.
3. Run before committing:
   ```bash
   ruff format
   ruff check
   ```
4. Test your change against a real Nautilus session:
   ```bash
   cp nautilus-my-computer.py ~/.local/share/nautilus-python/extensions/
   rm -rf ~/.local/share/nautilus-python/extensions/__pycache__
   nautilus -q; sleep 1 && nautilus
   ```
5. Commit messages follow `<type>: <short description>` (e.g. `fix: ...`, `feat: ...`,
   `i18n: ...`), imperative mood, max 72 characters.

## Reporting bugs

Open an issue with:
- Nautilus version and GNOME version
- Steps to reproduce, if you can
- Relevant log lines, with debug logging enabled:
  ```bash
  DEBUG=1 DISPLAY=:0 nohup nautilus --no-desktop > /tmp/nautilus.log 2>&1 &
  ```
  then grep for `MyComputer:` in `/tmp/nautilus.log`

**My Computer** started as a simple solo project and quickly grew into something
community-driven. Every translation, bug report, and pull request makes it better.
Thanks for being part of that, we're glad you're here!
